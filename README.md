## 🚀 Why use this library?

* **Proven effectiveness** – every prompt has been refined, tested, and tagged for a specific outcome.
* **Plug‑and‑play** – copy a system prompt before your own prompt, run it in the LLM of your choice.
* **Open for improvement** – we welcome your tweaks, edge‑cases, benchmarks, and new ideas.

2. Copy the prompt block .
3. Paste the prompt into your favourite model’s chat window or API call.

## 🎨 Customising a prompt
